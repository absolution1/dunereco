 This directory contains some example .fcl files to run different CVN jobs

 Producing event dump files for DUNE
===============================================================================

  - This is the basis of the image generation
  - There are separate .fcl files for fhc and rhc as the dump files contain
    pot weights. These weights depend on the beam polarity, and whilst not
    used directly (and are hardcoded in the CAFAna framework), then can be
    useful for making quick plots at training time. The use of these weights
    and the reconstructed energy from the MVA algorithms can be disabled.

  dune_cvn_event_dump_fhc.fcl
    - The standard event dump configuration for DUNE FHC mode

  dune_cvn_event_dump_rhc.fcl
    - The standard event dump configuration for DUNE RHC mode

===============================================================================
 Evaluating DUNE events with the CVN
===============================================================================

  dune_cvn_eval.fcl
   - This is the standard configuration to evaluate DUNE events with the CVN

  dunevd_3view is an older version of VD trainings for the deprecated 3view VD geometry
  Use dunehd_1x2x6_<zlib_maker, eval_fhc (rhc)> for processing/running over latest HD geometry/trainings
  Use dunevd_8x6_<zlib_maker, eval_fhc (rhc)> for processing/running over latest VD geometry/trainings

===============================================================================
  ProtoDUNE specific configurations
===============================================================================

 - It is important to note and remember that protoDUNE does not have any
   neutrino interactions. However, in order to test the CVN we can extract
   single reconstructed particles and generate separate images for all
   of them.

 protodune_cvn_event_dump.fcl
  - Produces a separate "event" dump for each reconstructed track and shower
    object in DUNE. A track length cut is applied in order to ensure these
    tracks are cosmic muons.

 protodune_cvn_eval.fcl
  - Standard configuration to evaluate each reconstructed object separately
    using the CVN.
